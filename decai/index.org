#+TITLE: The Internet Engineering Task Force, A Quick Intro
#+AUTHOR: Jeffrey I. Schiller
#+EMAIL: jis@mit.edu

* Who am I
  * Network Engineer, Software Developer, Security Guru
    * IETF Security Area Director 1994-2003
  * Built and ran MITâ€™s Network and networking infrastructure for 25
    years
* History
  * In the Beginning...
  * There was the ARPANet. It was governed by the Internet Activities
    Board (IAB).
    * PI's of the ARPANet Project
  * As the Internet became more independent, it morphed into what we
    have today.
* Structure
  * Internet Architecture Board (IAB) -- Over all direction
  * Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) -- Where documents are
    approved (Also selects Working Group (WG) Chairs
  * Working Groups -- Where the work actually gets done
    * Completely open to anyone who wishes to participate
    * You must give up IP rights to contributions you make
  * "Rough Consensus and Running Code!"
    Emphasis on what actually works
* Working Groups
  * Each working group reports to an Area Director
  * The set of Area Directors make up the IESG
  * Working Groups run by consensus
  * But the IESG votes approval
    * Yes, No Objection, Discuss
    * Note: No "No" Vote!
* A Meritocracy -- At least for a while
  * Early on when the Internet was under the radar...
    * Most contributors were altruistic
  * But then later...
    * Companies send people with agendas, sometimes to delay or
      destroy a standard
* Governance
  * IESG is the final approval body
  * Members of the IESG serve 2 year terms, appointed by a nominating
    committee
  * The Nominating Committee is misnamed, they are the deciders
    Though the IAB approves the selection, but that is really just a
    rubber stamp, or a final check.
* Nominating Committee
  * Chosen at random from volunteers who qualify
  * Random process is verifiable
* IETF Successes (Jeff's View)
  * Transport Layer Security (TLS)
  * IPv6 (??)
  * SMTP/MIME
    OK, I can quibble about this one, but the fact is that email works
    interoperably planet wide!
  * Interoperability is an important criteria for an Internet Standard
* IETF Weaknesses (Jeff's View)
  * Doesn't care about Programming Interfaces (APIs), yet they have a
    large impact on whether or not a change in protocol will ever get
    implemented!
  * BUSINESS CASES. The IETF ignores these. IPv6 is a good example.
* Questions?
